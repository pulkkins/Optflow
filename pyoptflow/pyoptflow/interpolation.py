  Parameters
  ----------
  I1 : array-like
    The first input image.
  I2 : array-like
    The second input image (must have the same shape as I1).
  VF : array-like
    The forward motion field (must have the same shape as I1 and I2).
  n : int
    Number of frames to interpolate between the input images.
  VB : array-like
    The backward motion field (must have the same shape as I1 and I2). If not 
    given, VB is assumed to be -VF.
  
  Returns
  -------
  out : list
    List of length n containing the interpolated frames between the images. 
    The input images are not included in the list.
